``FFTW-Age`` is a lightweight C++ utility for generating FFTW wisdom files
for OpenMP-multithreaded 3&#8209;d FFT transforms as a replacement for
[`fftw-wisdom`]( https://www.fftw.org/fftw-wisdom.1.html).

For background information, please refer to
[FFTW Wisdom](https://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Wisdom.html).


## Installation

The C++ program can built with `make`, provided that dependency
requirements (FFTW3 and OpenMP libraries) are satisfied.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure the C++ compiler used supports OpenMP and the FFTW3 library is
> installed/configured accordingly. The default [``Makefile``](Makefile)
> (located at the repository directory root) assumes the GCC compiler and
> OpenMP library.

First `git clone` the desired branch/release from the GitHub repository
and change into the repository directory path:

```bash session
git clone git@github.com:MikeSWang/FFTW-Age.git --branch <branch-or-release>
cd FFTW-Age
```

Then, execute in shell:

```bash session
make clean
make install
```


## Usage

Once installed, the FFTW-Age utility can be called from the command line:

```bash session
fftw-age [--rigour=<tplan>] [--outdir=<wisdom-dir>] <tdir>-<dimx>x<dimy>x<dimz>
```

where

- `fftw-age` is assumed to be executable (include the path if it is not
  in the current working directory);
- ``<tdir>`` is the transform direction,
  either ``"f"`` for ``FFTW_FORWARD`` and ``"b"`` for ``FFTW_BACKWARD``;
- ``<dimx>``, ``<dimy>`` and ``<dimz>`` are the dimensions of the 3-d transform;
- ``<tplan>`` corresponds to the FFTW planner flag/rigour level,
  with ``"m"`` (measured; default) for ``FFTW_MEASURE``
  and ``"p"`` (patient) for ``FFTW_PATIENT``;
- ``<wisdom-dir>`` is the output wisdom file directory
  (absolute or relative to the current working directory).

The output wisdom file will have the filename
``fftw_omp_<ttype><ttarr><tdir>_<dimx>x<dimy>x<dimz>_<tplan>.wisdom``.

> [!NOTE]
> Only complex-to-complex, in-place transforms are currently supported.  Hence
> ``<ttype>`` is fixed to ``"c"`` (complex-to-complex) and
> ``<ttarr>`` is fixed to ``"i"`` (in-place) for now.
